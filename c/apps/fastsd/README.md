# fastsd
This directory contains the software part for the fast SD controller, developed by Philipp Birkl and Martin Schwendinger for the course `Advanced Computer Architecture` at Technical Univerity of Vienna.

## Structure
The code is structured in logical blocks.
- `fatfs/` containes the implementation of FAT16/32 as well as vFAT written by [elm-chan][1].
- `sdclib/` containes the interface between the driver and the hardware.
- The root folder contains a simple demo application.
- Possibly a library `newlibfs-adapter` will be implemented to override the stub syscalls provided by newlib to get POSIX compatability. This however will conflict with the already given implementations in [patmos-newlib][2] as it is currently used to handle `STDOUT`.

## Build note
You may want to make sure that the offset setting of the IO device `SDCController` in `patmos/hardware/config/altde2-115.xml` matches the offset
`SDCIO_BASE` in `sdc\_io.c`.
